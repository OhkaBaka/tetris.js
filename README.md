# tetris.js
Simple tetris using only javascript and dynamic html.

A year or so back, my son and I started working on games independently (to encourage him to work on his coding). We chose to build tetris clones as a test of our skills, he in Scratch, me in js. It kept him focused for a bit to have some competition.

My intent was build a purely javascript engine, using no frameworks, launched from an otherwise empty html document.

I eventually stopped working on it, but the idea was a fun excercise, so I thought I would revisit it.
